### 1. Added `_lastEmptyTextController(int index)` Method
- Finds the last empty text controller before a specified index.
- Enables improved focus management to fill input gaps in OTP fields.

### 2. Enhanced `_onTextChanged` Logic
- Redirects input to last empty controller before current index.
- Supports multiple character input (pasting or fast typing) by splitting input across fields.
- Automatically moves focus forward or backward based on input or deletion.
- Calls `_handleOnComplete()` to detect when OTP input is complete.

### 3. Updated `_onBackButtonClick` Behavior
- Checks if current input text is empty with trimming.
- Removes clearing previous fieldâ€™s text on backspace; now only shifts focus backward.
- Improves natural keyboard navigation and input correction.

### 4. `TextField` Configuration Changes
- Added `maxLength`:
  - Set to 2 for all fields except last.
  - Set to 1 for the last field.
- Added `counterText: ''` to hide character counter.
- Changed order of `onChanged` callback calls to run internal logic before user callback.

### 5. Documentation and Code Clarity
- Added detailed doc-comments for new and updated methods.
- Improved error handling and comments in keyboard event logic.

### 6. Other Notes
- No changes in public API or constructor parameters.
- Paste handling logic remains functionally the same.
